Robot Framework Quick Start Guide
=================================

The Quick Start Guide introduces the most important `Robot Framework
<http://robotframework.org>`_ features. You can simply browse through it and
look at the examples, but you can also use the guide as an executable demo.

The guide itself is in `<QuickStart.rst>`_ file. It replaces the old version
available on the `old project pages`__.
